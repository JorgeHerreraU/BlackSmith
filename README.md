## üìê Infrastructure
- **Presentation Layer**
  - This is the "Desktop Client Application"
  - Based on [WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/designers/getting-started-with-wpf?view=vs-2022) Framework & [AdonisUI](https://benruehl.github.io/adonis-ui/) toolkit 
  - Designed with MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Pattern
  - Consumes Application Services Layer


- **Service Layer** 
  - Contains application services
  - Exposes the business logic through interfaces
  - Bridge between Presentation Layer and Domain Layer
  - Has Dto definitions to be able to return data without exposing the domain entities
  - Dto soft validations using C# built-in Data Annotations
  - Register injection dependencies


- **Business Layer**
  - Centralizes business rules ensuring data consistency and validity
  - [FluentValidation](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/) library is used for strongly-typed validations rules
  - Complex validations implemented against the database
  - Serves as an intermediary for data exchange between the Presentation Layer and the Data Access Layer


- **Domain Layer**
  - Domain entities 
  - Declares the IRepository interface bridging the data layer 


- **Data Access Layer**
  - Database infrastructure (mapping)
  - Implementation of the Repository interface
  - Holds database migrations
  - Separate the EF code needed for generating database tables at design-time from EF code used by your application at runtime


- **Core Layer**
  - Exposes Helpers, Extension Methods, Data Structures shared across layers
  - Common functionality (crosscutting concerns)
